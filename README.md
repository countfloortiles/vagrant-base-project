# Systems on Vagrant
This is a base project for working with multi-node Vagrant systems.  Using simple abstractions we can shift the focus of configuration away from the specifics of each machine and toward the architecture of a system as a whole.  By working with a JSON description of a system's architecture we make it simple to imagine external tools to make working with systems architecture in virtualized and cloud environments simpler.
